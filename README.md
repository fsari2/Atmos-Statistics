### ATMS597 - Statistics in Atmospheric Science

Hi! 
This repo is dedicated for all given assignments in the class of Statistics in Atmospheric Science. This class mostly covers basic statistics that is benefecial for atmospheric data analysis. 

The material contain:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to prepare for further analysis. In this first topic, a given problem explore basic statistic and plots such as time series, boxplot, histogram, KDE, violin, and scatter plot. The problem also require a brief script of correlation estimation. 
* Gamma and Extreme Value Distribution for precipitation data. Here the problem cover both monthly and daily analyis of precipitation over US Midwest area. In this topic, there is also a calculation of Standardized Precip. Index (SPI), two different extreme value distribution (GEV and Gen-Pareto), and their corresponding return period. 
* Trend analysis using Mann-Kendal Trend test for land-use land-cover from NDVI data. 
* Principal COmponent Analysis (PC/EOF) for temperature anomaly over South America.

This repo will be updated frequently [^1] as the problem come up .

[^1]: It could be once a week or so, but in total would be 7 scripts covering all basic statistics in Atmospheric Sciences

### Good Luck and Happy Sharing :sunglasses:
