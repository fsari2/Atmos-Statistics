### ATMS597 - Statistics in Atmospheric Science

Hi! 
This repo is dedicated to all given assignments in the Statistics in Atmospheric Science class. This class mostly covers basic statistics that are beneficial for atmospheric data analysis. 

The material contains:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to prepare for further analysis. In this first topic, a given problem explore basic statistic and plots such as time series, boxplot, histogram, KDE, violin, and scatter plot. The problem also requires a brief script of correlation estimation. 
* Gamma and Extreme Value Distribution for precipitation data. The problem covers monthly and daily precipitation analysis over the US Midwest area. In this topic, there is also a calculation of Standardized Precip. Index (SPI), two extreme value distributions (GEV and Gen-Pareto), and their corresponding return period. 
* Trend analysis using Mann-Kendal Trend test for land-use land-cover from NDVI data. 
* Principal Component Analysis (PC/EOF) for temperature anomaly over South America.
* Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) for soil moisture and precipitation over South America. 

This repo will be updated frequently [^1] as the problem comes up.

[^1]: It could be once a week or so, but in total, it would be 7 scripts covering all basic statistics in Atmospheric Sciences

### Good Luck and Happy Sharing :sunglasses:
